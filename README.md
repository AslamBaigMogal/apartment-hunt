This code appears to be implementing a function apartmentHunting, which takes in two arguments: blocks and reqs. The blocks argument is an array of blocks in an apartment complex, 
and reqs is an array of requirements that the function should consider when determining which block is the best to live in.

The apartmentHunting function first calls another function getMinDistance, which takes in a requirement item and the blocks array as arguments. This function returns an array result that
 represents the minimum distance from each block to the nearest requirement item.

The getMinDistance function then loops through the blocks array twice: once forwards, and once backwards. For each block, it checks if the block has the requirement item and if so, 
it updates the current closest block with the index of the current block. It then sets the value at the current index in the result array to be the absolute difference between the 
current closest block and the current block.

The getMinDistance function then returns the result array.

The apartmentHunting function then calls another function getMaxDistanceToAllReq, which takes in the nestedArr (the array returned from getMinDistance), reqs, and blocks as arguments.
 This function returns an array maxDistance that represents the maximum distance from each block to all the requirements in the reqs array.

The getMaxDistanceToAllReq function loops through the blocks array and for each block, it calculates the maximum distance to all requirements by looping through the nestedArr array and 
finding the maximum value in the subarray at the current index of the outer loop. It then sets the value at the current index in the maxDistance array to be this maximum distance.

Finally, the apartmentHunting function returns the index of the minimum value in the maxDistance array, which represents the index of the block that is the best to live in based on the 
requirements.
